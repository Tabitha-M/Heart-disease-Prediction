# Heart-disease-Prediction
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient health data such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical indicators, the model predicts whether a patient is at risk for heart disease. 
# Context

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths each year (~31% of all deaths). Most CVD-related deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and around one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years old.

Heart failure is a common outcome of CVDs. Early detection and management are critical, particularly for individuals at high cardiovascular risk (hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, or existing heart conditions). Machine learning models can help identify at-risk patients by analyzing medical data and predicting the likelihood of heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 918 observations with 12 attributes:

### Feature	Description
- Age	Age of the patient (years)
- Sex	Sex of the patient [M: Male, F: Female]
- ChestPainType	Chest pain type [TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic]
- RestingBP	Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- Cholesterol	Serum cholesterol (mg/dl)
- FastingBS	Fasting blood sugar [1: > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise]
- RestingECG	Resting electrocardiogram results [Normal, ST: ST-T wave abnormality, LVH: Left ventricular hypertrophy]
- MaxHR	Maximum heart rate achieved (60–202)
- ExerciseAngina	Exercise-induced angina [Y: Yes, N: No]
- Oldpeak	ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- ST_Slope	Slope of the peak exercise ST segment [Up, Flat, Down]
- HeartDisease	Target variable [1: heart disease, 0: Normal]
